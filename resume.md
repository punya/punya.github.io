## Industry experience

### Asapp (Dec 2016-present) - Senior Software Engineer
- Developing applications to deliver NLP capabilities in enterprise customer support

### Palantir (2011–2016) - Development Team Lead
- Co-owned backend for financial analysis product. Built and delivered multi-user scale and isolation subsystem (comparable to Chrome's process-per-tab). Prototyped shared-memory caching layer for fast restarts. (Spring Framework, Zookeeper)
- Drove Palantir-wide transition from monolithic backend built on a proprietary OSGi-like stack to Dropwizard-based microservices. Worked with multiple teams to analyze costs and benefits. Built shared tooling and standards for microservices.
- Drove adoption of Apache Spark at Palantir. Designed data-processing DSL and job-orchestration framework (comparable to Airflow). Built infrastructure to help data scientists deploy Python applications and notebooks while respecting Palantir's stringent network and data security requirements. Led development of a full-stack signals intelligence / top-down analysis product built on Spark / Vertica / Dropwizard / AngularJS. Contributed to Spark core and PySpark.
- Led a major re-architecture of the authentication microservice used across all Palantir products. Enabled customer-facing teams to integrate with SSO systems faster.
- Prototyped continuous deployment and centralized logging across Palantir's cloud-based products. Extended ELK stack and existing cloud deployment products to allow a central dev/ops team to monitor and manage a large number of customer-specific environments without leaking any sensitive information. (This work was still in progress when I left.)
- Led teams of 3-7 engineers. Responsible for career growth, technical mentorship, feedback and performance review. Hiring manager for a team of ~40 engineers.

### Microsoft (2010) - Research intern
- Research on theoretical topics (lower bounds for locale decidable codes, differential privacy for real-valued queries).

### Google (2005 and 2008) - Engineering intern
- 2008: Implemented distributed graph algorithms to benchmark new parallel processing system built to succeed MapReduce.
- 2005: Improved performance on applicant tracking system.

## Service
- 2015: Mentored a team of high school student entrepreneurs as part of the [Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship](https://www.nfte.com/)

## Education

### University of Washington (PhD candidate, 2007-2011)
- Research: Spectral graph theory, approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation.
- Teaching: TA for courses on randomized algorithms and software engineering.

### MIT (SB and MEng, 2002-2007)
- Selected coursework: Abstract algebra, graduate-level algorithms, cryptography.
- Teaching: Worked with Ron Rivest to revamp curriculum for introduction to algorithms. TA for compilers, graduate algorithms.
