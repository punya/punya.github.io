## Industry experience

### Google (2021–present) - Engineering Manager

I lead the teams responsible for Cloud Trace and Cloud Profiler, as well as Google's contributions to OpenTelemetry.

### TetraScience (2020) - Chief Technical Officer

TetraScience activates the flow of experimental data in the digital lab by automatically centralizing and harmonizing data gathered from instruments/CROs/CDMOs, to prepare it for data science and AI/ML processing. My responsibilities cover

- Platform engineering and product: Owning product vision and technology execution plan for the TetraScience data platform and the lab monitoring app.
- Delivery engineering: Extending the reach of the platform by integrating with scientific instruments, electronic lab notebooks and enterprise APIs.

including hiring and mentorship.

### ASAPP (2017–2019) - Director of Engineering

ASAPP's mission is delivering automation and work simplification to solve complex problems in the enterprise. I am responsible for the Foundations Engineering team, which encompasses SRE, application frameworks, data engineering and solutions architecture.

- Founded the team and grew it to 20 engineers (out of ~100 engineers total). Recruited a diverse and talented group of engineers across  across NYC, SF and Buenos Aires.
- Mentored and grew individual contributors and managers through 1:1s, architecture and code reviews, and continuous feedback.
- Responsible for evolution of overall system architecture. Created and maintained architecture diagram, presented to internal and external stakeholders.
- Held primary responsibility for overall delivery to one of ASAPP's earliest enterprise clients.
- Introduced or promoted key technologies used at ASAPP, including Kubernetes, Go unit testing, TypeScript, and Jest.

### Palantir (2011–2016) - Senior Engineering Manager / Technical Fellow

Note that "Development Team Lead" was my official title but my responsibilities include what is typical for technical fellows at other engineering-focused organizations.
- **Technical mentorship and guidance across the organization.** Organized engineering reviews and provided architectural feedback to teams embarking on significant project, especially concerning performance at scale and API design.
- **Co-owned backend for financial analysis product.** Built and delivered multi-user scale and isolation subsystem (comparable to Chrome's process-per-tab). Prototyped shared-memory caching layer for fast restarts. (Spring Framework, Zookeeper)
- **Drove Palantir-wide transition from proprietary OSGi-like stack to Dropwizard-based microservices.** Worked with multiple teams to analyze costs and benefits. Built shared tooling and standards for microservices.
- **Drove adoption of Apache Spark at Palantir.** Designed data-processing DSL and job-orchestration framework (comparable to Airflow). Built infrastructure to help data scientists deploy Python applications and notebooks while respecting Palantir's stringent network and data security requirements. Led development of a full-stack signals intelligence / top-down analysis product built on Spark / Vertica / Dropwizard / AngularJS. Contributed to Spark core and PySpark.
- **Led a major re-architecture of the authentication microservice used across all Palantir products.** Enabled customer-facing teams to integrate with SSO systems faster.
- **Built continuous deployment and centralized logging across Palantir's cloud-based products.** Extended ELK stack and existing cloud deployment products to allow a central dev/ops team to monitor and manage a large number of customer-specific environments without leaking any sensitive information. (This work was still in progress when I left.)
- **Managed teams of 3-7 engineers.** Responsible for career growth, technical mentorship, feedback and performance review. Hiring manager for a team of ~40 engineers.

### Microsoft (2010) - Research intern

- Research on theoretical topics (lower bounds for locale decidable codes, differential privacy for real-valued queries).

### Google (2005 and 2008) - Engineering intern

- 2008: Implemented distributed graph algorithms to benchmark new parallel processing system built to succeed MapReduce.
- 2005: Improved performance on applicant tracking system.

## Service

- 2016, 2017: Co-taught a course titled "Math, Modeling and Microbes" that introduced New Haven area high-schoolers to linear algebra in the context of epidemiology.
- 2015: Mentored a team of high school student entrepreneurs as part of the [Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship](https://www.nfte.com/)

## Education

### University of Washington (PhD candidate, 2007-2011)

- Research: Spectral graph theory, approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation.
- Teaching: TA for courses on randomized algorithms and software engineering.

### MIT (SB and MEng, 2002-2007)

- Selected coursework: Abstract algebra, graduate-level algorithms, cryptography.
- Teaching: Worked with Prof. Ron Rivest to revamp curriculum for introduction to algorithms. TA for compilers, graduate algorithms.
